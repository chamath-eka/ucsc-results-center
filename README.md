✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, a Smart, fast and extensible build system.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## Generate code

If you happen to use Nx plugins, you can leverage code generators that might come with it.

Run `nx list` to get a list of available plugins and whether they have generators. Then run `nx list <plugin-name>` to see what generators are available.

Learn more about [Nx generators on the docs](https://nx.dev/plugin-features/use-code-generators).

## Running tasks

To execute tasks with Nx use the following syntax:

```
nx <target> <project> <...options>
```

You can also run multiple targets:

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2>
```

..or add `-p` to filter specific projects

```
nx run-many -t <target1> <target2> -p <proj1> <proj2>
```

Targets can be defined in the `package.json` or `projects.json`. Learn more [in the docs](https://nx.dev/core-features/run-tasks).

## Want better Editor Integration?

Have a look at the [Nx Console extensions](https://nx.dev/nx-console). It provides autocomplete support, a UI for exploring and running tasks & generators, and more! Available for VSCode, IntelliJ and comes with a LSP for Vim users.

## Ready to deploy?

Just run `nx build demoapp` to build the application. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory, ready to be deployed.

## Set up CI!

Nx comes with local caching already built-in (check your `nx.json`). On CI you might want to go a step further.

- [Set up remote caching](https://nx.dev/core-features/share-your-cache)
- [Set up task distribution across multiple machines](https://nx.dev/core-features/distribute-task-execution)

##   Commit message semantics  

feat: Short for "feature," this prefix is used when introducing a new feature or functionality to the codebase. For example:

feat: Add user authentication feature
chore: This prefix is used for commits related to maintenance tasks, build processes, or other non-user-facing changes. It typically includes tasks that don't directly impact the functionality but are necessary for the project's development and maintenance. For example:

chore: Update dependencies
chore: Refactor build script
fix: Used when addressing a bug or issue in the codebase. This prefix indicates that the commit contains a fix for a problem. For example:

fix: Correct calculation in revenue calculation
docs: Used when making changes to documentation, including comments in the code, README files, or any other documentation associated with the project. For example:

docs: Update API documentation
style: This prefix is used for code style changes, such as formatting, indentation, and whitespace adjustments. It's important to separate style changes from functional changes for better clarity. For example:

style: Format code according to style guide
refactor: Used when making changes to the codebase that do not introduce new features or fix issues but involve restructuring or optimizing existing code. For example:

refactor: Reorganize folder structure
test: Used when adding or modifying tests for the codebase, including unit tests, integration tests, and other forms of testing. For example:

test: Add unit tests for user authentication
perf: Short for "performance," this prefix is used when making changes aimed at improving the performance of the codebase. For example:

perf: Optimize database queries for faster response times
